# cs425-rockFIIT

IMPORTANT: In order to run...
  You will need node.js and expo installed. Clone repository (or simply download rockfiit folder), and enter the rockFIIT folder using your terminal. Run npm install to install expo to the project. Then simply run npm start, and open the project on an emulator or your mobile device.
  
NOTE: All of the dependencies should be included in the github folder. We have had some errors where some get uninstalled upon cloning, though. In this case, just run npm install ..., where ... is the dependency that the errors are saying could not be found.
